# üìÅ File Management Platform

This project is a comprehensive summary of the back-end trimester topics, covering authentication, NodeJS, MongoDB, Redis, pagination, and background processing. The objective is to build a simple platform for uploading and viewing files with functionalities such as user authentication via a token, listing all files, uploading new files, changing file permissions, viewing files, and generating thumbnails for images.

## Project Overview

---

The **File Management Platform** is designed to provide users with the ability to manage their files securely and efficiently. It includes features such as:

- User authentication using tokens.
- Listing all uploaded files.
- Uploading new files.
- Changing file permissions.
- Viewing files.
- Generating thumbnails for image files.

## Features

---

- **üîê User Authentication:** Secure authentication mechanism using tokens.
- **üìÑ File Listing:** List all uploaded files with pagination.
- **üì§ File Upload:** Upload new files to the platform.
- **üîÑ Permission Management:** Change the permissions of files (e.g., private, public).
- **üëÅÔ∏è File Viewing:** View the content of uploaded files.
- **üñºÔ∏è Thumbnail Generation:** Generate and view thumbnails for image files.
- **‚öôÔ∏è Background Processing:** Use background workers for processing tasks such as thumbnail generation.

## Learning Objectives

---

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

1. **Create an API with Express:**
   - Set up a Node.js server with Express.
   - Define API endpoints for file management.

2. **Authenticate a User:**
   - Implement token-based authentication.
   - Secure API endpoints using authentication middleware.

3. **Store Data in MongoDB:**
   - Connect to a MongoDB database.
   - Perform CRUD operations on MongoDB collections.

4. **Store Temporary Data in Redis:**
   - Set up Redis for caching and temporary data storage.
   - Use Redis for session management and caching.

5. **Setup and Use a Background Worker:**
   - Implement background processing using a worker library (e.g., Bull).
   - Process tasks such as thumbnail generation in the background.

## Technologies Used

---

- **Node.js:** JavaScript runtime for building the server.
- **Express.js:** Web framework for building APIs.
- **MongoDB:** NoSQL database for storing file metadata.
- **Redis:** In-memory data structure store for caching and temporary data.
- **Bull:** Background job processing library.
- **Multer:** Middleware for handling file uploads.
- **JWT:** JSON Web Tokens for user authentication.

## Setup and Installation

---

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/file-management-platform.git
   cd file-management-platform
  
2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```
   npm install

3. **Set Up Environment Variables:**
   *Create a .env file in the root directory and add the following environment variables:*
   ```
   PORT=3000
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/file_management
   REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
4. **Start the Server:**
   ```
   npm start
