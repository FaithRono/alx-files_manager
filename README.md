# 📁 File Management Platform
This project is a comprehensive summary of the back-end trimester topics, covering authentication, NodeJS, MongoDB, Redis, pagination, and background processing. The objective is to build a simple platform for uploading and viewing files with functionalities such as user authentication via a token, listing all files, uploading new files, changing file permissions, viewing files, and generating thumbnails for images.

##Project Overview
The File Management Platform is designed to provide users with the ability to manage their files securely and efficiently. It includes features such as:

-User authentication using tokens.
-Listing all uploaded files.
-Uploading new files.
-Changing file permissions.
-Viewing files.
-Generating thumbnails for image files.

###Features
1). **🔐 User Authentication: Secure authentication mechanism using tokens.**
2). 📄 File Listing: List all uploaded files with pagination.
3). 📤 File Upload: Upload new files to the platform.
4). 🔄 Permission Management: Change the permissions of files (e.g., private, public).
5). 👁️ File Viewing: View the content of uploaded files.
6). 🖼️ Thumbnail Generation: Generate and view thumbnails for image files.
7). ⚙️ Background Processing: Use background workers for processing tasks such as thumbnail generation.

###Learning Objectives

-Create an API with Express:

Set up a Node.js server with Express.
Define API endpoints for file management.
Authenticate a User:

Implement token-based authentication.
Secure API endpoints using authentication middleware.
Store Data in MongoDB:

Connect to a MongoDB database.
Perform CRUD operations on MongoDB collections.
Store Temporary Data in Redis:

Set up Redis for caching and temporary data storage.
Use Redis for session management and caching.
Setup and Use a Background Worker:

Implement background processing using a worker library (e.g., Bull).
Process tasks such as thumbnail generation in the background.
